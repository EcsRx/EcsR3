# Third Party Content!

Big thanks to all the community who help out with SystemsR3/EcsR3.

> While this is the R3 version of EcsRx a lot of the tutorials and information on the EcsRx project can be applied here as they are almost identical in terms of high level functionality.

## Hey, I want to have my plugin listed too!

Great stuff buddy, all you need to do is add it here in a PR with a link to the plugin (with optional profile link) and a blurb about what the plugin is/does, or if you don't fancy that just raise an issue detailing the above and we can add it for you.
